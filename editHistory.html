      <h3>PRICES OF COMMODITIES AND THEIR IMPACT ON CONSUMERS AND INDUSTRY</h3>

      <p>
        "Prices are too much!" That's the usual cry of the average Ghanaian.
        Indeed, this has impacted negatively on the efforts of governments in
        the past and present.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        An optimal growth of industry is dear to the heart of every government
        and its people as equally as low prices of industrial goods and services
        to the final consumer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>The metrics that heals the above phenomenom cannot be far fetched.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As industry produces goods and services, there must be a check on the
        intermediary players (middlemen) in such a manner that price increases
        would not affect the final consumer. Research has revealed that some
        commodities have as much as four middlemen between the producer and the
        final consumer. What it means is each member within the chain makes a
        margin on the same good or service. By the time it reaches the final
        consumer the prices escalate beyond imagination. Unfortunately, it is
        the poor of the poor country men and women who are the most affected.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It takes the commitment of governments through legislations and the
        like, to control these developments as it may drastically reduce prices
        of goods and services. To cite few examples - in the past, Ghana Highway
        Authority or PWD directly employs and pay workmen to clear along major
        roads across the country. Government directly procures goods to a state
        run GNTC in the least developed communities as retail outlets to common
        people. Life was good. Because it was like from the manufactures
        straight to consumers. No middleman.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The above thinking may bring about increased consumption, favourable
        competition with imported goods, low demand for foreign currency,
        middlemen being employed by industries because of expanded base due to
        increased demand, increased government revenue on account of increased
        formal employment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When serious attention is paid to these things, we may once attain the
        height we desired as a nation.<br />

        <h3>FULL EMPLOYMENT IN GHANA'S PERSPECTIVE</h3>
        <p>
          'There is no work in Ghana'. We say there's work in Ghana depending on
          the lens through which we see the naratives from various angles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The early economists as Keynes postulates full employment as a
          yard-stick for a good quality of life. It further asserts that any able
          bodied person who wants to work can find employment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Work, in simple terms is the combination of all factors of production
          that brings about an output, which are goods and services consumed by
          the masses. In our part of the world, so much emphasis is paid to labour
          within the chain of these factors that all the others are barely
          considered or partially tapped.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The following points show details of all factors worth considering:<br />
          <b>Labour</b> - the human resources (workmen, engineers, lawyers,
          teachers, medics, administrators) etc.<br />
          <b>Land</b> - rivers, lakes, seas, forests, agricultural lands, mineral
          deposits, air space.<br />
          <b>Capital</b> - man-made resources acquired by use of money.<br />
          <b>Entrepreneurship</b> - organisational resources for management and
          coordination (governments and individuals).<br />
          <b>Information and Technology</b> - use of data and technology in all
          aspects of production processes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our problem for not attaining full employment is the fact that less
          projection is made for the quality of life for the average Ghanaian.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          If Koohia, a farmer in the Atiwa District is deemed fit to at least,
          live in a decent self owned house, it should take the government as the
          chief entrepreneur to easily coordinate all the rest of the factors of
          production to his advantage. That's making him produce better. In doing
          these, the subsequent action is that other factors are going to be
          activated as they are needed to complete the cycle.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is therefore expected that routine analysis is made about the
          quantum, in percentage terms, how much of the factors of production is
          tapped and how much is left untapped so that potential entrepreneurs can
          set into motion what needs to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          The function of the government in this case is to coordinate for the
          betterment of all citizens in a frank manner. Nothing else.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A positive outlook at the above discussion renders all people happy and
          productive for a Great Nation.
