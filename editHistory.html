      <h3>PRICES OF COMMODITIES AND THEIR IMPACT ON CONSUMERS AND INDUSTRY</h3>

      <p>
        "Prices are too much!" That's the usual cry of the average Ghanaian.
        Indeed, this has impacted negatively on the efforts of governments in
        the past and present.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        An optimal growth of industry is dear to the heart of every government
        and its people as equally as low prices of industrial goods and services
        to the final consumer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>The metrics that heals the above phenomenom cannot be far fetched.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As industry produces goods and services, there must be a check on the
        intermediary players (middlemen) in such a manner that price increases
        would not affect the final consumer. Research has revealed that some
        commodities have as much as four middlemen between the producer and the
        final consumer. What it means is each member within the chain makes a
        margin on the same good or service. By the time it reaches the final
        consumer the prices escalate beyond imagination. Unfortunately, it is
        the poor of the poor country men and women who are the most affected.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It takes the commitment of governments through legislations and the
        like, to control these developments as it may drastically reduce prices
        of goods and services. To cite few examples - in the past, Ghana Highway
        Authority or PWD directly employs and pay workmen to clear along major
        roads across the country. Government directly procures goods to a state
        run GNTC in the least developed communities as retail outlets to common
        people. Life was good. Because it was like from the manufactures
        straight to consumers. No middleman.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The above thinking may bring about increased consumption, favourable
        competition with imported goods, low demand for foreign currency,
        middlemen being employed by industries because of expanded base due to
        increased demand, increased government revenue on account of increased
        formal employment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When serious attention is paid to these things, we may once attain the
        height we desired as a nation.<br />

        <h3>FULL EMPLOYMENT IN GHANA'S PERSPECTIVE</h3>
        <p>
          'There is no work in Ghana'. We say there's work in Ghana depending on
          the lens through which we see the naratives from various angles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The early economists as Keynes postulates full employment as a
          yard-stick for a good quality of life. It further asserts that any able
          bodied person who wants to work can find employment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Work, in simple terms is the combination of all factors of production
          that brings about an output, which are goods and services consumed by
          the masses. In our part of the world, so much emphasis is paid to labour
          within the chain of these factors that all the others are barely
          considered or partially tapped.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The following points show details of all factors worth considering:<br />
          <b>Labour</b> - the human resources (workmen, engineers, lawyers,
          teachers, medics, administrators) etc.<br />
          <b>Land</b> - rivers, lakes, seas, forests, agricultural lands, mineral
          deposits, air space.<br />
          <b>Capital</b> - man-made resources acquired by use of money.<br />
          <b>Entrepreneurship</b> - organisational resources for management and
          coordination (governments and individuals).<br />
          <b>Information and Technology</b> - use of data and technology in all
          aspects of production processes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our problem for not attaining full employment is the fact that less
          projection is made for the quality of life for the average Ghanaian.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          If Koohia, a farmer in the Atiwa District is deemed fit to at least,
          live in a decent self owned house, it should take the government as the
          chief entrepreneur to easily coordinate all the rest of the factors of
          production to his advantage. That's making him produce better. In doing
          these, the subsequent action is that other factors are going to be
          activated as they are needed to complete the cycle.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is therefore expected that routine analysis is made about the
          quantum, in percentage terms, how much of the factors of production is
          tapped and how much is left untapped so that potential entrepreneurs can
          set into motion what needs to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          The function of the government in this case is to coordinate for the
          betterment of all citizens in a frank manner. Nothing else.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A positive outlook at the above discussion renders all people happy and
          productive for a Great Nation.

        <!--<h3>ENHANCING SMALL SCALE ANIMAL REARING AND CROP PRODUCTION IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES</h3> 
        <p>
        Rural communities contribute immensely to animal and crop protein needs of the nation.
        
        </p><br>
        <p>
        
        A walk around the countryside witnesses struggles rural folks endure in keeping the balance between livestock raising and crop growing. In a situation where a typical farmer attempts to make a garden of vegetables and the like, it becomes difficult for such farmer to raise animals at the same time. This is because the least chance the animals get they destroy the crops.
        </p><p><br>
        
        It comes to mind that there needs to be an intervention from government where logistics like netting systems, is developed and sold on moderate prices for these rural farmers to protect their crops from being destroyed by farm animals.
        
        </p><p><br>
        Its a common sight to note that mosquito nets supplied by Bill Gate Foundation plays an important role in this crop protection endeavours, quite contrary to the purpose for which they are supplied.
        </p><p><br>
        
        Frankly, the aggregates of small scale animal rearing and backyard gardening by families throughout the country can do enough for our food sustainability.

       <!-- <h3>POTENTIAL INJURIES AND DEATHS IN THE RUN UP TO 2024 ELECTIONS</h3>
        <p>
          Political intolerance has once again shown its ugly heads in the midst
          of various political activities across the country.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Its only God who knows who would get hurt, who gets killed in cold
          blood and those that would suffer all kinds of psychological nuances.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As much as party people struggle to outwit their opponents through
          uncultured means as insults, threats, open fights and gun shots,
          citizens must keep distance from them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>The big question asked by many is what causes all these?</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A quick remedy to these situations is to reduce the financial benefits
          of political offices to the normal public office emolument levels
          such as that of teachers. There, one can experience a drastic
          reduction in hostilities that accompany political aspirations, and
          those who have the state at heart would be seen at work.

       <!-- <h3>HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF THE "24-HOUR ECONOMY" POLICY</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Politicians are resolute in their promise to the electorate. More often,
          further thinking is not applied to their concepts, making it open to
          failures and miscalculated realities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          24-hour economy as promised by the incoming administration, in other
          jurisdictions succeeded on account of many factors. Indeed our citizens
          touted it in many instances where they work tirelessly across few
          industries to make fortunes for themselves.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The metrics are simple: The 24-Hour Economy concept would only succeed
          at the back of expanded quality of life â€“ increased wages and salaries,
          lower cost of living, higher standard of living, lower energy cost,
          lower taxes and maximum security.
        </p>
        <br />
  
        <p>
          A case in point is a household which consumes 20 tins of milk a month.
          As milk manufacturing industry expands, there must be corresponding
          higher consumption of same household. When this is not projected, it
          would be very difficult for the concept to stand.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Export market alone for foreign exchange would meet the normal cyclical
          economic performance if the standards of living are not considered
          first.

          It has been a tested case that any duty a person who has ever been to
          a college of education and called a teacher performs is done
          creditably for at least devoid of wanton corruption.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Going back, Professor John Evans Atta Mills and Kwame Nkrumah stood
          tall as the best among their peers in serving this country truthfully,
          to the satisfaction of every level-headed Ghanaian because they were
          teachers who had gone through Training Colleges.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A call to these analyses is premised on the happenings around the
          country where polling stations that did not field teachers as
          Presiding Officers, Returning officers and Collation Officers in the
          various constituencies had to face myriads of irregularities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If indeed the officers who manned these desks were teachers, it could
          be the types who did not attend Colleges of Education, but products of
          universities that ended up in the classrooms. Such teachers, because
          of their flare for money, they become easily corrupted. That is the
          problem we are seeing today.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Colleges of Education are good training grounds for the best materials
          that teach our future generations, because I can say, it is an
          embodiment of virtues. If for any reason itâ€™s thought through to make
          it look like normal universities, Ghana has a big price to pay in the
          future.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Electoral commission must in its future engagements, use genuine
          teachers without party colors to conduct elections.

      <h3>APPOINTMENT OF DISTRICT CHIEF EXECUTIVES AND THE THINGS THAT MATTER</h3>
      <p>
        It must be an optimum expectation of all District Chief Executives to
        put revenue mobilization as their top priorities. In other
        jurisdictions, much revenue is generated within the district to pay
        remunerations for government workers, their staff and contract fees.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What becomes of Ghanaâ€™s local government system? About 90 percent of
        revenues are rolled away. Probably, scrutinized measures of capturing
        these essential monies are lacking.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Rent taxes as per Rent Act, 1963 (Act 220),  which now stands at 8 percent must be looked at with a
        serious eye. Here, the Land Lords and Tenants must collaborate for the
        District to derive the full benefit from this.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Thatâ€™s to say for a property to be rented out, a prescribed Tenancy
        Agreement Form must be sourced from the District Assembly. A duplicate
        of the form with appropriate tax payment must be returned to the District
        Office for validation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Tenants can be awarded a subsidy on percentage terms of the tax paid by
        their landlords by way of cushioning their expenses.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Assembly Members must be at the fore front of these transactions
        as their core mandate.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Any infraction on the law on the part of members of the Assemblies,
        Land Lords, ant Tenants must be dealt with appropriately for a
        multiplier outcomes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        These and others such as property tax, market tolls and annual
        payment of all artisans such as tailors, seamstresses, mechanics etc.
        can go a long way to keep the finances of the districts healthy.
      </p>
