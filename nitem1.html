    <p><i>By News Desk</i></p>
    <p>
      TSC Technical Institute, Awutu Beraku first appeared in the Computerized
      School Selection Program in the 2021/23 academic Year. Many residents of
      Awutu know nothing about the existence of the institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      A visit to the school reveals a simple one shed structure, housing a
      workshop, one or two offices and a concrete floored yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      One cannot tell the number of students who get admission to the institute
      and if any serious work goes on there. But there is an indication
      that it sort of trains students for practical work unlike the case of most
      Technical Institutes and Senior High Technical schools we know of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other facts reveal that it was established as a training centre for those
      who desire to do machine related programs, by the District Assembly's
      Rural Enterprises Program.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worthy of note that many types of power tools were found in the
      workshop that according to sources, are meant for any form of machine
      parts moulding, with the state of the art designing tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the tools spotted at the workshop includes Lathe, Milling
      machines, grinders, sanders and many more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea for such an establishment at the district level is commendable.
      One would like to see it expanded and given the desired importance. At
      this level of Ghana's development, that is what we need as a people. White
      color engagements have outlived their usefullness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a fit mixed with the much touted STEM education can in a long way
      help Ghana rub shoulders with advance technologies around the world.
