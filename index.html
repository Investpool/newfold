            <p>
              Our communities hold a special place in our childhood memories.
              Family relationships, neighbourhoods and infrastructure are just a
              few of the things we remember growing up in our various
              communities.
            </p>

            <p>
              Along the way, families relocate to other cities in search of jobs
              and other attractions. The most common factors underlying these
              migrations are urbanisation, prestige which comes along with
              economic and social modernization.
            </p>

            <p>
              This leaves the countryside in the hands of the elderly and those
              who don’t travel because they can’t afford to, and because they
              don’t have any connections in the cities.
            </p>
            <p>
              In perspective, communities must be showcased with all potentials
              for growth, be it social or economic. Its sad to note that most
              communties that nurtured our generations in past and now for its
              splendour and love are now left behind, deserted and uncared for.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking back, its worth considering a special attention paid to
              our source of inspiration and growth. Coming back to our places of
              birth after a long working years would in one way or the other
              give encouragement to the young ones to do same. The ultimate is
              to ensure a balanced regional development where all places
              throughout the country are enhanced, befitting a human status.
            </p>
            <p>
              Its the duty of our educated youths to eschew selfishness and
              speak for the voiceless in the areas of general concern,
              especially the responsibility of the central government.
            </p>

              the toils of his kinsmen now pays so much tax to the government.
              His root of origin is left to His people who till this day share
              the same creek waters with cattle and other animals. Indeed
              citizens and the state must contribute to the growth of every
              community.

          <h6 class="info_head">GREATER ACCRA REGION</h6>
          <p>
            Accra is a cosmopolitan area and the capital city of Ghana. There
            are diverse economic activities in the Region ranging from medium
            scale manufacturing industries owned by multi nationals, to small
            scale (one-man) manufacturing hubs. The Shai and Dangme areas too
            record a little agricultural production.
          </p>
          <p>
            The area of interest to <b>NEWSBOX</b> is the small scale entities.
            These hubs are identified and mapped for a possible recommendations,
            support and expansion.
          </p>
          <h6 class="info_head">CENTRAL REGION</h6>
          <p>
            By popular opinion, the Central Region is estimated to be one of the
            poorest regions in the country. This is obvious on account of high
            rate of teenage pregnancy as recorded by the National statistics
            data of 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are potentials for high agro industrial output as its the hub
            for pineaple and potato production especially on the Gomoa plains
            and parts of Awutu District. Factories for converting these crops
            into secondary products is the game changer as it employs hundreds
            of teenage mothers for a life time engagement.
          </p>

          <h6 class="info_head">EASTERN REGION</h6>
          <p>
            Eastern Region is a resource rich part of Ghana. From mining
            activities to small scale agriculture in forest zones and that of
            Volta plains. Fishing activities in the Afram Plains area cannot be
            left out.
          </p>

          <p>
            One notable area of interest is the fisheries sector, where much
            investment can be made in cat fish and tilapia production. Processes
            are underway for a research into those productive ventures
            especially along the Volta River.
          </p>
          <h6 class="info_head">WESTERN REGION</h6>
          <p>
            Western Region is the hub of all energy production activities
            including other petrochemical entities. Thanks to an average
            production capacities of gas that runs our thermal engines for the
            supply of electricity to households.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the forest nature of the environment promises a high
            level of raw material productions for a good industrial
            considerations. Eyes are wide opened to see what comes out of our
            researches and engagements.
          </p>

          <h6 class="info_head">WESTERN NORTH REGION</h6>
          <p>
            This Region is a break away part of Western Region as a result of
            government's programm aimed at making administrative functions
            closer to the people. It shares same productive values with the
            Western Region. Detailed outlook is under way to establish its
            productive capacity vis a vis the national output.
          </p>
          <h6 class="info_head">BONO REGION</h6>
          <p>
            The region is a satisfying ecological enclave with an optimum
            primary productive activities. Unfortunately, less industrial
            establishments are spotted in this area of the country.
          </p>
          This is believed to be associated with the distance from the
          administrative capital, Accra coupled with poor networked roads.
          <h6 class="info_head">BONO EAST REGION</h6>
          <p>
            The Volta River makes a lot of the environment in which the Bono
            East is situated. Much more can be done with the fishing industry in
            this area. Rigorous attention is paid to revealing the true state of
            the region for sustainable development
          </p>
          <h6 class="info_head">AHAFO REGION</h6>
          <p>
            Ahafo shares the same ecological features with Bono Region. Yam,
            Tomatoes and maize production is the main agricultural fits of the
            region. The impact of Government's role in the region would be
            assessed and reported to stakeholders.
          </p>
          <!--<h6 class="info_head">ASHANTI REGION</h6> -->
          <h6 class="info_head">NORTHERN REGION</h6>
          <p>
            Northern Region is a developing area by means of infrastructural add
            ups in the capital city, Tamale and its environs. Up north is a vast
            agricultural lands that has all it takes to qualify the region for
            grain basket of the entire country, especially in the area of guinea
            corn production.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its believed that when greater percentage of the productive
            activities are mechanized and the irrigation status of White Volta
            is totally established, things would change for the better.
          </p>

          <p>
            Upper West Region is the northwesterly part of Ghana and a home for
            many renowned personalities in the productive agricultural space.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a hub of fair natural resources, the region has its major
            industries in animal and food crop productions. National statistics
            does not indicate the quantum of these production levels vis a vis
            the national averages. However its worthy of note that sufficient
            productions are made for local consumptions and export to
            neighboring countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>NEWSBOX</b> in furthering its coverage of the region, projects to
            make account of the rate and the level at which these raw primary
            products are made and the percentage that is changed into secondary
            products. Personalities championing the productive industries would
            be promoted in such a way that more room is created for them to
            excel.
          </p>
          <p>
            The number of industrial establishments in the regions is equally an
            important concern for our assessment. Through this, we hope to
            provide adequate infographics for public consumption and investment
            processes.
          </p>
          <h6 class="info_head">UPPER EAST REGION</h6>
          <p>
            Upper East Region with Bawku as a buzzling marketing center links
            two international frontiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Different kinds of products, both industrial and agricultural find
            their way into the region. This is associated with the fact that it
            connects the sahel to the south.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is therefore apparent that much smoother commercial links to the
            region, by way of ownership and management of supply chains are
            needed to ensure a sustainable business environment as well as
            pricing modalities.

          <p>
            Volta Region has the potential of feeding the entire nation with its
            rice production capabilities. Its noted that about seven varieties
            of rice are grown in the region with great looks and nutritive
            values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately the farmers use agrarian technologies accounting for
            very low output. Mechanization is projected to be enhanced to a
            remarkable rate along side complete marketing strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Details of industrial activities in this area would be made
            available to stakeholders in due course.
