            <p>
              Our communities hold a special place in our childhood memories.
              Family relationships, neighbourhoods and infrastructure are just a
              few of the things we remember growing up in our various
              communities.
            </p>

            <p>
              Along the way, families relocate to other cities in search of
              jobs, other attractions, and even the simple act of relocating.
              The most common factor underlying these migrations is
              urbanisation, which entails economic and social modernization.
            </p>

            <p>
              This leaves the countryside in the hands of the elderly and those
              who don’t travel because they can’t afford to, because they don’t
              have any connections in the cities.
            </p>
            <p>
              In perspective, communities must be showcased with all potentials
              for growth, be it social or economic.
            </p>
            <p>

          <h3 class="info_head">GREATER ACCRA REGION</h3>
          <p>
            Accra is a cosmopolitan area and the capital city of Ghana. There
            are diverse economic activities in the Region ranging from medium
            scale manufacturing industries owned by multi nationals, to small
            scale (one-man) manufacturing hubs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The area of interest to <b>NEWSBOX</b> is the small scale entities.
            These hubs are identified and mapped for a possible recommendations,
            support and expansion.
          </p>
          <h3 class="info_head">CENTRAL REGION</h3>
          <p>By popular opinion, the Central Region is estimated to be one of the
          poorest regions in the country. This is obvious on account of high
          rate of teenage pregnancy as recorded by the National statistics data
          of 2020.
        </p>
          <p>There are potentials for high agro industrial output as its
          the hub for pineaple and potato production especially on the Gomoa
          plains and parts of Awutu District. Factories for converting these
          crops into secondary products is the game changer as it employs
          hundreds of teenage mothers for a life time engagement.</p>
          
           

          <h3 class="info_head">EASTERN REGION</h3>
          <p>Eastern Region is a resource rich part of Ghana. From mining
          activities to small scale agriculture in forest zones and that of Volta plains. Fishing activities
           in the Afram Plains area cannot be left out.</p>
          
           <p>One notable area of interest is the
          fisheries sector, where much investment can be made in cat fish and tilapia production. Processes are 
          underway for a research into those productive ventures especially along the Volta River.
          </p>
          <!-- <h3 class="info_head">WESTERN REGION</h3>

          <h3 class="info_head">WESTERN NORTH REGION</h3> -->
          <h3 class="info_head">BONO REGION</h3>
          <p>
            The region is a satisfying ecological enclave with an optimum
            primary productive activities. Unfortunately, less industrial
            establishments are spotted in this area of the country.
          </p>
          This is believed to be associated with the distance from the
          administrative capital, Accra coupled with poor networked roads.
          <!-- <h3 class="info_head">BONO EAST REGION</h3>
          <h3 class="info_head">AHAFO REGION</h3>
          <h3 class="info_head">ASHANTI REGION</h3> -->
          <h3 class="info_head">NORTHERN REGION</h3>
          <p>
            Northern Region is a developing area by means of infrastructural add
            ups in the capital city, Tamale and its environs. Up north is a vast agricultural lands that has
            all it takes to qualify the region for grain basket of the entire country, especially in the area of
            guinea corn production.
          </p> 
            <p>Its believed that when greater percentage of the productive activities 
            are mechanized and the irrigation status of White Volta is totally established, things would 
            change for the better. 
          </p>

          <!-- <h3 class="info_head">NORTH EAST REGION</h3>
          <h3 class="info_head">SAVANNAH REGION</h3> -->
          <h3 class="info_head">UPPER WEST REGION</h3>
          <p>
            Upper West Region is the northwesterly part of Ghana and a home for
            many renowned personalities in the productive agricultural space.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a hub of fair natural resources, the region has its major
            industries in animal and food crop productions. National statistics
            does not indicate the quantum of these production levels vis a vis
            the national averages. However its worthy of note that sufficient
            productions are made for local consumptions and export to
            neighboring countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>NEWSBOX</b> in furthering its coverage of the region, projects to
            make account of the rate and the level at which these raw primary
            products are made and the percentage that is changed into secondary
            products. Personalities championing the productive industries would
            be promoted in such a way that more room would be created for them
            to excel.
          </p>
          <p>
            The number of industrial establishments in the regions is equally an
            important concern for our assessment. Through this, we hope to
            provide adequate infographics for public consumption and investment
            processes.
          </p>
          <h3 class="info_head">UPPER EAST REGION</h3>
          <p>
            Upper East Region with Bawku as a buzzling marketing center links
            two international frontiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Different kinds of products, both industrial and agricultural find
            their way into the region. This is associated with the fact that it
            connects the sahel to the south.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is therefore apparent that much smoother commercial links to the
            region, by way of ownership and management of supply chains are
            needed to ensure a sustainable business environment.
          </p>
          <!-- <h3 class="info_head">OTI REGION</h3> -->
          <h3 class="info_head">VOLTA REGION</h3>
          <p>
            Volta Region has the potential of feeding the entire nation with its rice production capabilities.
          Its noted that about seven varieties of rice are grown in the region with greate looks and nutritive values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately the farmers use agrarian technologies accounting for very output. Mechanization is projected to
          be enhanced to a remarkable rate along side complete marketing strategies.
          </p>
           <p>Details of industrial take of in this area would be made available to stakeholders in due course.</p>
