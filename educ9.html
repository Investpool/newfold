        <p>
          As part of the Irish National Day celebration officially known as
          Saint Patrick’s Day, Ireland’s Minister of State for International
          Development and Diaspora, Sean Fleming, led a delegation to meet with
          UG Vice-Chancellor Prof. Nana Aba Appiah Amfo at the University of
          Ghana. Both parties stressed the importance of education and potential
          partnerships in areas of health, communication, agriculture,
          technology among others.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In opening the meeting, Mrs. Emelia Agyei-Mensah, Registrar of the
          University of Ghana, provided an overview of the University’
          structure, emphasising the importance of the collegiate system as well
          as the University’s role in contributing to national and global
          development.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Nana Aba Appiah Amfo, in her remarks,
          extended a special welcome to the visiting delegation. She
          acknowledged the fact that the visit was prioritised as part of the
          Saint Patrick’s Day, which is the official Irish National Day
          celebration.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As a means for finding similar areas of interest, Prof. Amfo outlined
          the seven (7) research priorities of the University which are;
          Infectious and non-communicable diseases; Enhancing food production
          and processing including improved approaches to breeding;
          Trans-disciplinary Research into Climate Change Adaptation;
          Development Policy, Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation; Politics,
          Socio-cultural change, Mobility and Development; Creative Arts,
          Education and Communication, and Information Literacy; and Fourth
          Industrial Revolution tools (Artificial Intelligence, data science,
          machine learning, digital transformation, etc.) She reiterated that
          partnerships in these research areas are critical for national and
          global development.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In his remarks, Minister of State for International Development and
          Diaspora, Ireland, Sean Fleming, underscored the pivotal role of
          education in national and global development. According to him,
          Ireland places high value on education and has taken deliberate steps
          to ensure a highly educated workforce. He pointed out the positive
          impact of education on Ireland's standard of living and echoed the
          country's prioritisation of education, recognising it as the key to
          the future. This, in his view, calls for the need to have good
          cooperation and diverse exchanges between Ireland and Ghana as well as
          across the broader African continent.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ambassador Peter Ryan, the Ambassador of Ireland to Ghana, Nigeria and
          ECOWAS, reinforced the conversation by spotlighting the impact of
          Ireland’s educational system on their economics. He noted that a key
          feature of Ireland’s education is international connectivity. He
          believes that a strong bond and collaboration in areas of technology,
          agriculture, biotechnology and other disciplines will not only
          strengthen the ties but improve development both at the local and
          global levels. Ambassador Ryan also looks forward to joint research
          projects between University of Ghana and Irish Universities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Dean of International Programmes, Prof. Eric Osei-Assibey,
          highlighted the shared history between Ireland and Ghana stemming from
          their affiliation with Britain, while also underlining the
          significance of broadening collaboration with European universities.
          He stressed the importance of the European Region Action Schemes for
          the Mobility of University Students (ERASMUS+) programme as a primary
          driver of academic mobility. Prof. Osei-Assibey asserted that both
          parties must make a concerted effort to expand student exchanges
          across various disciplines to capitalise on the mutual strengths.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Prof. Emmanuel Debrah, Director for Legon Centre for International
          Affairs and Diplomacy (LECIAD) affirmed the importance of inter-state
          relations. He stated that LECIAD, sharing the same goals of
          international connectivity serves as a platform for training foreign
          service personnel. Prof. Debrah reiterated UG’s openness and eagerness
          to cultivate partnerships with Ireland.
