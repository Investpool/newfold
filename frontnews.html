            ECG revenue into a single account doesn’t solve current power crisis
            – John Jinapor
          </h1>
        </div>

        <div
          class="date"
          style="font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: smaller"
        >
          23th April, 2024
        </div>

        <p>
          Ranking Member on Parliament’s Mines and Energy Committee, John
          Jinapor, has said that the Finance Ministry’s decision to put all of
          the Electricity Company of Ghana’s (ECG) revenue collected into a
          single account does not solve the current power crisis.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This comes after Finance Minister, Dr Mohammed Amin Adam disclosed
          that a single account has been established for ECG's revenue
          collection.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At a press conference on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank
          Spring Meetings in Washington DC, USA, Dr Amin Adam said the move will
          ensure that tracing revenue collected by the ECG will not be a
          challenging task.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But speaking on Newsnight on JoyFM on April 22, John Jinapor said the
          current power crisis is a result of challenges in securing funds to
          procure fuel that has resulted in intermittent power cuts.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He stated that the solutions given by the Finance Minister will do
          little to solve the power crisis if funds are not raised to purchase
          fuel.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “First of all, if you decide that all ECG revenue should go into one
          bank account how does that resolve the problem? The PURC tracks every
          penny. I'm telling you that the PURC has a foothold on all the
          revenues that come to ECG. The challenge is the issue of losses.
          Secondly, we are talking of an immediate challenge of fuel.”
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “So the question is how do we get money today to buy the fuel? That is
          what Ghanaians are interested in. Not long-term measures. As for the
          long-term measures they are good. You can implement them. But as we
          speak today, today there's going to be a deficit of 500 megawatts on
          account of the inability to procure fuel. So what is the Finance
          Minister doing to have these utilities to buy the fuel?” he quizzed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Additionally, Mr Jinapor noted that the government has contributed to
          the energy crisis after failing to consistently pay its portion of the
          power consumed by government agencies such as those in the health
          sector.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “...GH₵200 million every month, they fail to pay that. If the Finance
          Minister pays that money today, GH₵1.6 billion, the utilities can buy
          fuel. I'm hearing the Finance Minister say that they are negotiating
          with the IPP [Independent Power Producers], and if they negotiate,
          they will make savings.”
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “During the State of the Nation Address, the President was categorical
          that they have done the negotiations and even mentioned savings. So
          even credibility is a problem,” he said.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Yapei-Kusawgu MP stated that it is prudent to have the Finance
          Minister re-prioritize government expenditure and help utility
          companies and power producers buy fuel within the shortest possible
          time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This, he believes, would help resolve the current power crisis and
          give room for the government to implement its medium to long-term
          measures.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The intermittent power outages continue to have a devastating effect
          on businesses across the country.
