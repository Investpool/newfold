        <div

          15th April, 2024
        </div>

        <p>
          The government is determined not to overburden Ghanaians with the
          payment of more taxes, Dr Mohammed Amin Adam, the Finance Minister,
          has assured.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Rather, the government would ‘use the hard way’ to collect revenue
          from those who have not been paying the appropriate taxes, as well as
          those who have been evading taxes in the country.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dr Amin Adam said this during a press briefing on Saturday, April 13,
          after Ghana reached a staff-level agreement with the International
          Monetary Fund (IMF) on the country’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
          arrangement.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Minister noted that the suspension of the 15 per cent Value Added
          Tax (VAT) on electricity consumption and GHS100 annual levy on owners
          of petrol and diesel vehicles, had created a GHS1.8 billion revenue
          gap.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He indicated that there was an urgent need to increase revenue in line
          with the implementation of the US$3 billion loan-support programme,
          but the government was also being careful not to burden the few
          Ghanaian taxpayers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As such, the government would be resolute in ensuring the effective
          implementation of revenue generation mechanisms announced, both in the
          2023 and 2024 budgets, but lacked effective implementation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “Now, we’re determined to go out there and collect the taxes from
          those who have not been paying and those who have been evading
          taxes…to generate the desired revenue to fill the gap created due to
          the suspension of the taxes,” he said.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dr Amin Adam also stated that the government was pursuing reforms
          within the tax administration to ensure that proper assessments were
          done, and people made to pay the appropriate taxes to the state in the
          easiest and fastest ways possible.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Minister was quick to add that aggressive revenue mobilisation
          alone, would not be an ideal situation for the country, therefore,
          there would be a focus on expenditure rationalisation too.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Responding to a question posed to him by the Ghana News Agency on
          pragmatic expenditure control measures, he stated that the government
          had been implementing an arrears-clearing plan to address outstanding
          payments.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Additionally, it was onboarding more agencies to the Government
          Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) to stop
          state institutions from spending beyond their budget as well as any
          unapproved expenditure.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dr Amin Adam said the government felt the pains that Ghanaians,
          individuals and businesses alike, had to endure as a result of the
          implementation of reforms under the ongoing IMF loan-support
          programme.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          While lauding Ghanaians for the sacrifices made since the
          implementation of the programme in May 2023, he encouraged them to
          continue to remain patient and sacrificial.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “Some of the reforms that we’re implementing are biting, but I know
          that we’ll persevere and lead together, and ensure that the benefits
          of the fiscal consolidation will bring significant relief to the
          people of Ghana so that we can be counted once again as one of the
          fastest growing in the world,” he said.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ms Julie Essiam, the Commissioner-General of the Ghana Revenue
          Authority (GRA), provided further details on the alternative revenue
          mobilisation efforts to fill in the GHS1.8bn revenue gap created by
          the suspension of two tax handles.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          She said that the Commission had intensified efforts to ensure the
          effective implementation of compliance measures on the foreign income
          of resident Ghanaians in the country.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In doing so, GRA and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
          Development (OECD) have gone through credible and sustainable
          structures to ensure it generates the GHS1.8bn revenue that the
          electricity and waste pollution tax were to provide.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dr Ernest Addison, Governor, Bank of Ghana (BoG), reiterated the
          government’s determination to making sure that state institutions
          worked to change the narrative of election expenditure derailing
          economic progress in the country.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “In Ghana’s recent history, we have not been able to successfully
          implement an IMF-supported programme in an election year without
          derailment,” the Central Bank Governor said.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “The Government and the Central Bank are committed to changing that
          narrative…and we will remain committed to ensure that programme
          implementation stays firm,” he added.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Meanwhile, it is expected that when the IMF Board meets in June this
          year, it would approve Ghana’s GHS$360m third tranche, following a
          staff-level agreement reached between Ghanaian authorities and the IMF
          Mission team.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That would bring the total disbursement for Ghana’s ECF arrangement
          backed by the country’s Post-COVID-19 Programme for Economic Growth
          (PC-PEG) to US$1.56 bn.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Already, the country had received the sum of US$1.2 bn from the first
          two tranches since the implementation of the US$3bn-three-year IMF
          loan-support programme.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The programme is aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability and debt
          sustainability, build resilience, and lay the foundation for stronger
          and more inclusive growth.
