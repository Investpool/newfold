      <h1>PUBLIC REACTIONS OVER GHâ‚µ 1 ENERGY TAX ON FUEL</h1>

          Public reactions over the 1 cedi energy levy slapped by the NDC
          government has aroused several sentiments and would soon die down. It
          looks like those in favour are those that are against the management
          style of the erstwhile NPP government. Their argument is simple. "You
          have accumulated so much debt and someone finds ways and means to pay
          them, what is your take?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Transport operators too agued, "You did not discuss any matter
          concerning the levy with us, only to do that at our blind side. We
          would not agree."
        </p>

        <p>
          Those on the side of wisdom say, the President means well by imploring
          the citizens to take the move as a bitter pill because if its not
          done, the consequencies would be dire. One commentator argued on a
          platform that "in London, one pays higher taxes for the least
          transaction you can imagine but citizens are happy to pay because such
          monies create an excellent system for human beings to live in." He
          cited an instance where even an open space in front of your house is
          paid for on hourly bases when you park a car.
        </p>
        <p>
          So i ask a question to conclude the matter. "Is it not because foreign
          systems are built well with taxes, that our leaders pride themselves in
          travelling to those places?" If the answer is yes, ladies and
          gentlemen, let's allow the government of the day to do their work now
          that good signs are clearly written on the wall - Inflation brought
          down to 18 percent, exchange rate in its lowest of almost 10 cedis to the dollar,
          transport fares reduced and prices of few goods reduced.
