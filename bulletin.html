      <h1>MAHAMA LAUNCHES YOUTH ENTREPRENEURIAL PROGRAMME “ADWUMAWURA”</h1>
      <p class="writer">By News Desk</p>

         <p>
          The President John Mahama has launched the government’s flagship
          programme, ‘Adwumawura’ at the Prempeh Assembly Hall, Kumasi.
        </p>

        <p>
          This aims at tackling youth unemployment challenges and ignite
          entrepreneurial inclusion across Ghana.
        </p>

        <p>
          The programme is a special business start-up initiative crafted to
          facilitate the creation, tracking, and mentoring of at least 10,000
          businesses every year, with a strong focus on empowering young people,
          driven by the National Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme
          (NEIP) of Ministry of Youth and Empowerment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Targeting Ghanaians aged 18 to 35, the programme promises to equip the
          next generation with the tools to start, grow, and sustain their
          businesses — a lifeline for thousands seeking economic independence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Adwumawura forms a central pillar of the National Democratic Congress
          (NDC)’s 2024 manifesto, underlining the party’s sweeping commitment to
          create 250,000 jobs annually through various initiatives, including
          the much-touted “Edwuma Pa” programme.
        </p>

        <p>
          By leaning heavily into entrepreneurship, skills development, and
          digital innovation, the Mahama-led Government aims to reposition
          Ghana’s youth as the vanguard of national economic growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Backing this ambition, the 2025 Budget Statement presented by Finance
          Minister Cassiel Ato Forson in March allocated a hefty GH₵100 million
          to kickstart the Adwumawura programme.
        </p>

        <p>
          The funds will support young entrepreneurs with skills training,
          mentorship, access to start-up capital, and provision of equipment — a
          holistic strategy to ensure businesses not only survive but thrive.
        </p>

        <p>
          In complement to Adwumawura, the Government’s National Apprenticeship
          Programme will provide free technical and vocational training,
          certification, and post-training start-up support.
        </p>

        <p>
          This twin-track strategy is designed to tackle youth unemployment
          head-on by blending formal entrepreneurial support with practical
          skills training.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, the administration is sweetening the deal for emerging
          businesses: start-ups will enjoy a two-year exemption from corporate
          and personal income taxes to ease the early financial pressures of new
          ventures.
        </p>

        <p>
          Minister of Youth Development and Empowerment, George Opare Addo, in a
          video message shared on Sunday, reaffirmed the Government’s unwavering
          commitment.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to the Minister, the 2024 election promise, to create decent
          and sustainable jobs for young people was being put to action. He
