      <h1>THE GHANAIAN CEDI PERFORMS MARGINALLY AGAINST THE DOLLAR</h1>
      <p class="writer">By News Desk</p>

        <p>
          The positive performance of the Ghana Cedi across the major trading
          currencies in recent times comes as the relief to both trading and the
          consuming public.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately these is not the time of a price control system where
          the government would succeed in imploring the trading public to reduce
          prices of their merchandise.
        </p>

        <p>
          One space for sure for the government to influence, according to views
          sampled from our outfit is the major shopping malls which must be made
          as the destination of shoppers if really reduced prices of things is
          sgood thing to experience now.
        </p>

        <p>
          Indications from the Bank of Ghana suggest that more dollars are
          pumped into the system and also increase in gold reserves by the State
          and other fiscal measures by the current administration are making the
          trick.
        </p>

        <p>
          Its the hope of all citizens that these development is sustained to
          increase purchasing power of ordinary Ghanaians and increase
          production of industries resulting in increased employment.
