          11th April, 2024
        </div>
        <p>
          Three teachers held for alleged employment scam have been granted a
          GH¢350,000.00 bail each by an Accra Circuit Court.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Samuel Mensah Amelikpo, David Bacha Ntenyam and Daniel Ofori Boateng
          are to get two sureties each.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          They are to report to the Police every Wednesday while the case is
          adjourned to April 30, 2024.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All the three denied conspiring to defraud 42 persons of GHC394,500.00
          under the pretext of securing jobs with the GES.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Police Chief Inspector, Daniel Danku told the Court presided over by
          Mr Samuel Bright Acquah that Sumaila Awueidze, the complainant was
          unemployed and resident of Kukurantumi in the Eastern Region.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He said Amelipko lived at Awoshie, a suburb of Accra, Bacha, resident
          of Asamankese, Eastern Region, while Boateng stayed at Effiduase in
          the Ashanti Region. They are all professional teachers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In August 2023, Amelikpo communicated to the complainant that GES
          recruitment slots were available and that he had protocol to recruit
          people.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Amelipko during the conversation allegedly gave full assurance and
          promised to make refund when the recruitment failed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The prosecution said due to such representation, the complainant
          became convinced and organised forty-two (42) interested applicants.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It said on August 29, 2023, Amelikpo demanded and collected
          GHC394,000.00 from the complainants to get them the jobs but they
          failed to do so and went into hiding.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Court held that all efforts made by the complainant to reach
          Amelikpo proved futile hence a report made to the police.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The prosecution said on October 18, 2023, Amelikpo was arrested at
          Odorgonno Accra and in his investigation cautioned statement, he
          admitted having collected the above-mentioned amount of money from the
          complainant to secure jobs for his applicants but failed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Amelikpo mentioned Bacha and Boateng as his accomplices, leading to
          their arrest on November 10, 2023, at Asamankese and Asante Effiduase
          respectively.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The prosecution told the Court that Bacha in his cautioned statement
          admitted the offence and told the Police that he only received
          GH¢388,000.00 from Amelikpo and same was handed over to Boateng and
          one Reuben Bempoh for the recruitment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Boateng in his cautioned statement also admitted having received
          monies from Amelikpo and Bacha but paid into the Vodafone Cash wallet
          accounts produced by Bempoh, whom he met online and also claimed
          working at GES, National Headquarters Accra.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          During investigation, the police retrieved GHC70,000.00 from Boateng
          and same was handed over to the complainant. The police are still
          investigating the matter.
