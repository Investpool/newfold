          The Ministry of Agriculture announces the price for rice, maize and
          gari on the 29th September, 2025. This follows the maiden meeting of
          the Producer Price Determination Committee held on the 11 - 12th
          September in Accra.

          A bag of maize (100kg) is to be purchased for Ghs450, 50kg bag of rice
          for Ghs625, and 34kg bag of gari for Ghs340

          The crops are to be purchased by the National Food Buffer Stock
          Company to serve as a stable price guaranteee for farmers across the
          country. The Director of the company emphasized that farmers should
          not suffer extreme low prices of their harvest on account of bumper
          harvest

          Other participants of the meeting urged the government to expand the
          accessibility fo the company to make it readily reachable to farmrs in
