            Ghana must industrialise before investing in solar, other renewables

          11th April, 2024
        </div>
        <p>
          Mr Jonathan Amoako-Baah, a former Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana
          Grid Company Limited (GRIDCo), says investment in renewable energy,
          including solar is not a viable option to drive Ghana’s
          industrialisation agenda.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He said in the wake of the intermittent power challenges, the country
          should focus on establishing a “very big” base load such as a nuclear
          power plant that would offer reliable and affordable power to champion
          massive industrialization for development.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Mr Amoako-Baah, a former Board Member of the Nuclear Power Institute
          (NPI) under the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC), made the call
          when some Staff members and Management of the Nuclear Power Ghana
          (NPG) paid a courtesy call on him at his residence in Koforidua in the
          Eastern Region.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The visit was heralded by a tour of the Boti Falls in the Eastern
          Region as part of NPG’s activities to commemorate the Ghana Heritage
          Month.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Mr Amoako-Baah said the country required “conventional plants” as
          baseload to guarantee a reliable supply of power for industries.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He said in the wake of the depletion of the country’s hydro resources,
          nuclear power remained the viable option to power Ghana’s
          industrialisation plan in the long term.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “Renewables cannot power the industries; Tema Steel or VALCO is a case
          in point. VALCO takes about 345MWe. How much renewable can you put to
          generate such power considering the intermittent nature of renewable
          and capacity factors? In the night and during some seasons, you do not
          have the sun to power the solar panels. The wind is also not
          consistent.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “You need a very big baseload plant; conventional plants like hydro
          (which has been used up); thermal or nuclear. Nuclear is the new thing
          now,” he said.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Mr Amoako-Baah called for the active continuation of Ghana’s Nuclear
          Power Programme to enable the country to achieve the target of
          building and operating the first nuclear power plant in the near
          future.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “The work must continue for us to be able to establish the first
          nuclear power plant by 2030. Government should pay attention to this,”
          he said.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Energy experts estimate that beyond 2025, Akosombo and Kpong
          Hydropower Plants, the nation’s baseload supply points which currently
          serve 32 per cent of electricity demand, would have reduced
          drastically to about 25 per cent.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ghana in its quest to access affordable and stable power to
          industrialize sustainably as well as to meet the global energy
          transition from fossil fuel to clean energy, is seeking to include
          nuclear power in its energy mix.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The deployment of nuclear power in Ghana is also in line with the
          country’s medium-term development plans and climate commitments under
          the Paris Agreement.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He said the NPG under the policy direction of the Ministry of Energy
          had targeted taking “firm decisions” on the technology, the financing
          arrangements, and the project structure this year.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “We have really advanced and the target this year is to be able to
          come out with a decision on the vendor and the technology… I am
          certain,” Dr Yamoah said.
