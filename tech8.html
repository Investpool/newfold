        <p>
          A Professor of Mathematics Education at the University of Cape Coast
          (UCC), Professor Ernest Kofi Davis has suggested that mathematics
          curricula be rooted in the social and cultural contexts that students
          are familiar with to make teaching and learning easier.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Such curricula, he stated, must incorporate students’ values and
          ideals and socio-cultural norms to make the study of mathematics
          likeable. He said it was high time Ghana looked at the "local aspect
          of mathematics pedagogy and their implications for curriculum
          development and implementation."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Prof. Davis proposed that when he delivered his inaugural lecture on
          the theme "Socio-Cultural Issues: A missing ingredient in mathematics
          curriculum development and delivery in Ghana," last Thursday.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Prof. Davis, also the Provost of the College of Distance Education
          (CoDE) at the UCC, emphasised that doing this would help facilitate
          the development of student's mathematical competence in a more
          accessible manner.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He observed that the performance of Sub-Saharan students in
          mathematics had been reported as abysmally low.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He said this was a result of the adoption of foreign concepts in
          teaching mathematics in Sub-Saharan educational institutions. Prof.
          Davis explained that every culture generated the mathematics that
          suited its culture.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, he noted that adopted Western and international teaching of
          Mathematics in Sub-Saharan Africa made it difficult for students to
          link those abstract mathematical concepts to their everyday realities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          "Mathematics is, therefore, often presented out of context to
          students, making it extremely difficult for them to link the abstract
          mathematical concepts they encounter in school to their everyday
          realities,” Prof. Davis said.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He said because of those foreign concepts, it had been difficult for
          primary schoolchildren in Saharan Africa including Ghana to link what
          they culturally know to what they are taught in the classroom.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The mathematics professor observed that the poor performance of
          primary school pupils in sub-Saharan Africa had also affected
          secondary school-level education. He explained that due to the poor
          performance in basic schools, it had become difficult for students to
          further their studies and professions in Science, Technology,
          Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          "At the senior high school level, the performance of students from
          Sub-Saharan African countries and ethnic minorities in international
          comparative assessment in mathematics and science had also been
          consistently low.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          "Literature suggests that every culture generates its mathematics that
          may not be the same as the Western or international mathematics,"
          Prof. Davis added. Drawing from research, he urged Sub-Saharan African
          countries to pay attention to the mathematics of their culture.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Prof. Davis stated that every student had the potential to excel in
          mathematics, despite what others may believe and that their success
          largely depended on the unfavourable curricula they found themselves
          in.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He appealed for improved learning conditions to promote effective
          teaching.
