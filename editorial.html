          From looting to recovery: Have you exhausted the Auditor-General’s
          2024 report? If you have, then you know it is not a book of numbers,
          it is a record of suffering. GH¢18.4 billion, about US$1.47 billion at
          today’s Bank of Ghana rate, is not a statistic, it is a stolen future.
          It is the child who went to school without food, the patient who sat
          in pain because the medicine never came, the farmer who watched his
          harvest waste while politicians signed contracts in air-conditioned
          rooms. Each irregularity is not an error on paper, it is a wound
          carved into the lives of ordinary Ghanaians.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Take the Electricity Company of Ghana under Samuel Dubik Mahama. The
          auditors found ECG collected GH¢11.59 billion but declared GH¢8.63
          billion. That is a gap of nearly GH¢3 billion. Imagine what that
          means: enough to supply every senior high school with free textbooks
          for years. Instead, the money slipped into the fog of
          under-declarations. ECG also withheld GH¢1.29 billion from the very
          power producers who keep the lights on. And when they did spend, it
          was GH¢75 million handed to Hubtel without even a contract, later
          dressed up in a retroactive single source deal never approved by the
          Public Procurement Authority Board. Ghost vehicles, phantom tablets,
          inflated conductor prices, the company that powers our homes was
          running on shadows.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          And while all this was happening, families in Kasoa and Tamale sat
          through power cuts, children struggled over their homework with phone
          torches, and patients in hospitals were told to bring their own
          oxygen. That is what a GH¢2.95 billion under-declaration really looks
          like when you step outside the accounting books.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          ECG’s rot does not end on paper. At Tema Port, an independent audit
          showed over 1,300 ECG containers unaccounted for. The Ministry of
          Energy, led by Dr. John Jinapor, set up a tracking committee, arrests
          were made, and later investigations traced about 2,637 containers
          linked to ECG. Yet not all the boxes are back in the ledger: dozens
          remained unaccounted for, and some retrieved had never been recorded
          in ECG’s books. By July 2025, the Energy Minister confirmed the
          missing count had dropped to 23. This is not closure; it is evidence
          of how easily national assets slip into the fog of weak records and
          porous oversight.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          It was not only ECG. At the Bulk Oil Storage and Transportation
          Company (BOST), contracts were signed outside the mandatory
          e-procurement system, projects stalled, and devices bought with public
          money gathered dust. The Minerals Income Investment Fund (MIIF), under
          Edward Nana Yaw Koranteng, advanced US$3.8 million, seventy percent,
          on a US$5.42 million contract, flouting the Public Financial
          Management Act which caps such advances at fifteen percent. The
          National Lottery Authority under Samuel Awuku withheld GH¢1.44 million
          in taxes in 2022 and GH¢3.28 million in 2023, never remitted to the
          Ghana Revenue Authority. The State Interests and Governance Authority
          under Edward Boateng failed to collect GH¢749,000 in rent arrears from
          state enterprises. Even the Ghana Library Authority, custodian of
          learning, sat on over a million cedis in withholding taxes between
          2019 and 2023.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          And the culprits are not faceless. They were CEOs, Directors,
          Ministers, and regulators. They drove past children hawking at traffic
          lights, knowing their decisions had stripped the state of the very
          resources that could have changed those children’s lives. They sat in
          air-conditioned conference rooms and signed away public funds while
          the rest of the country queued at NHIS offices, waited at ECG prepaid
          meters, or begged for boreholes in rural villages.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          And yet even this is not the full picture. There are red flags not
          captured in the Auditor-General’s report, irregularities that never
          made it onto the printed pages. From sweetheart contracts in obscure
          agencies to unexplained transfers buried in classified accounts, the
          questions multiply. If GH¢18.4 billion is what was found, how much
          more lies hidden in the shadows?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Today, there is a new government. President John Mahama has launched
          Operation Recover All Loot. Its committee, chaired by Samuel Okudzeto
          Ablakwa, reviewed 36 high-profile cases valued at over US$20 billion
          and handed its dossier to the Attorney General. National Security has
          already made arrests in the ECG container scandal. The Office of the
          Special Prosecutor is probing a GH¢280 million fraud at the National
          Petroleum Authority. EOCO has reopened the Cecilia Dapaah docket.
          Cases from mining, procurement, and financial institutions are now
          before prosecutors.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          But the real test is not in speeches. It is in the mother in Techiman
          who pays VAT on a tin of milk, expecting that her money will reach the
          state. It is in the teacher in Hohoe who waits for chalk, only to be
          told there is no money. It is in the farmer in Sefwi who applied for a
          COCOBOD seed fund loan and was told the coffers were empty. They are
          the true auditors of Ghana, and they know the difference between
          promises and prosecutions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Even the shadows cannot hide this reality: Ghana is not poor. Ghana is
          being plundered through paperwork. And the victims are not in
          Parliament or boardrooms; they are in the villages, markets, and
          hospital corridors.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Auditor-General has spoken. The law has been triggered. Now the
          people wait to see whether Operation Recover All Loot will remain a
          slogan or become a scalpel. Because if GH¢18.4 billion can vanish in
          one year while children sit in darkness, then every Ghanaian is owed
          not just an audit, but justice.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          This time, we cannot afford another report gathering dust. This time,
          we must see names in court, assets seized, accounts frozen, and
          handcuffs clinking louder than excuses.
