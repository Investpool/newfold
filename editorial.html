        <h3>
          PRICES OF COMMODITIES AND THEIR IMPACT ON CONSUMERS AND INDUSTRY
        </h3>

        <p>
          "Prices are too much!" That's the usual cry of an average Ghanaian.
          Indeed this has impacted negatively on the efforts of governments in the
          past and present.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          An optimal growth of industry is dear to the heart of every
          government and its people as equally as low prices of industrial goods
          and services to the final consumer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The metrics that heals the above phenomenom cannot be far fetched.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As industry produces goods and services, there must be a check on the
          intermediary players(middlemen) in such a manner that price increases
          would not affect the final consumer. Research has revealed that some
          commodities have as much as four middlemen between the producer and
          the final consumer. What it means is each member within the chain makes a
          margin on the same good or service. By the time it reaches the final
          consumer the prices escalate beyond imagination. Unfortunately, it is
          the poor of the poor country men and women who are at this end of the
          chain.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It takes the commitment of governments through legislations and the
          like to control these developments as it may drastically reduce prices
          of goods and services. To cite few examples - in the past, Ghana
          Highway Authority or PWD directly employs and pay workmen to clear
          along major roads across the country. Government directly procures
          goods to a state run GNTC in the least developed communities as retail
          outlets to common people. Life was good. Because it was like from the
          manufactures straight to consumers. No middleman.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The above thinking may bring about increased consumption, favourable
          competition with imported goods, low demand for foreign currency,  middlemen being employed by
          industries because of expanded base due to increased demand, increased
          government revenue on account of increased formal employment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When serious attention is paid to these things, we may once attain the
          height we desired as a nation.<br/>
