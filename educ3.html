          <b
            >The Vice-Chancellor of the Central University (CU), Professor Bill
            Buenar Puplampu, has called on the government to consider
            partnerships with credible private universities as an alternative to
            deal with the challenges of providing higher education in the
            country.</b
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “You would have noticed from the President’s State of the Nation
          Address (SONA) in February and his pronouncements at the just-ended
          13th Africa Games that the government intends to bring new state
          universities on stream to respond to increasing SHS graduation
          numbers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “I have often suggested that government should partner with credible
          private universities as an alternative to expand the state sector with
          its attendant burdens on the exchequer,” the Vice-Chancellor stated at
          the 27th Matriculation ceremony of the university at Miotso in the
          Greater Accra Region.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Prof. Puplampu added, “We shall not stop arguing that a viable
          strategy to even out access to higher education is a fee
          credit/voucher system. Such a system will allow Ghanaian students to
          take up available slots in private universities of choice and only top
          up fees where needed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “There are far too many over-crowded lecture halls in public
          universities, while similar programme spaces remain available in
          private institutions,” he added.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Central University is making significant strides towards enhancing its
          academic programmes and focusing on real-world impact. With a faculty
          member strength of close to 200, as well as an equal number of
          administrators, the institution operates across three campuses:
          Miotso, Christ Temple and Kumasi.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At present, the university boasts of a diverse range of academic
          offerings, including over 35 undergraduate programmes, a thriving
          Award for Training in Higher Education (ATHE) programmes with three
          levels of qualifications and 20 graduate programmes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, Prof. Puplampu said the university was embarking on a process
          of rationalisation to consolidate its strengths in the Applied
          Sciences and Applied Social Sciences.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He outlined the university’s strategic direction to include plans to
          deepen its offerings in areas such as health and the sciences with a
          particular focus on nursing programmes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “Moreover, there are plans underway to introduce the Bachelor of
          Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) programme within the next two
          years to further enhance the institution's contribution to healthcare
          education,” the Vice-Chancellor stated.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Additionally, he said, Central University was set to bolster its
          capacity in the built environment and introduce a series of joint
          degrees that allowed students to pursue interdisciplinary studies
          across the Social Sciences and Applied Sciences.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Prof. Puplampu stressed that the university emphasised the importance
          of ensuring that each degree aligned with three key objectives —
          facilitating career success, supporting national development and
          fostering community engagement. facilitate career success, the
          Vice-Chancellor said the university was committed to assisting its
          graduates in transitioning into the workforce, pursuing fulfilling
          careers and securing their economic well-being as ethical and
          transformative global citizens.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “When it comes to supporting national development, the university aims
          to support the country's human capital development agenda and
          contribute towards achieving the government's goal of a 40 per cent
          Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education,” he said.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Touching on community engagement, Prof. Puplampu explained that
          graduates were expected to play a significant role in contributing to
          the welfare of the church, the State and local communities.
