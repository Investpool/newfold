          <p>
            In a recent interview with Kofi TV, Funny Face, who is on a
            GH¢120,000 bail, for charges related to careless and inconsiderate
            driving, as well as two counts of negligently causing harm, owned up
            to his actions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            "I've caused problems for myself. I understand that there are
            spiritual things in the world but I won’t blame anyone. There are
            times people get weary of your deeds and that id the point I’ve
            gotten to.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            “Nobody will understand what you are going through. I would say I am
            the major factor of my problems. I am a man dealing with inner
            demons,” he said.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Funny Face, who shot to fame for his role in Chorkor Trotro series
            said he is working hard to emerge from the darkness with newfound
            clarity and purpose.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            He pointed out that he won’t blame people for growing weary of his
            actions, however, on one truly understands the depth of his personal
            struggles.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Irrespective of that, he takes full responsibility of his actions
            and pleads for forgiveness. He also expressed gratitude to all who
            offered support, particularly thanking Ghanaians for their warmth
            and assistance during his time of need.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            He attributed his resilience to divine guidance, emphasizing the
            importance of relying on a higher power to navigate life's
            challenges.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            “Not everyone can survive what I’ve been through in all the stages
            of my life. Now, I feel down but I don’t feel all is lost. I’ve
            advised and encouraged myself of happenings in my life. In life, you
            can’t always be too careful unless you have the backing of God.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            “That is why I always have this popular saying, ‘Gye Nyame’. Until
            God permits it, some things can never happen. So in this life, it’s
            all about God.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            “But now I feel like a new person who is taking life seriously now..
            To God be the glory, I will be 43 years old this year. I can say I
            used 42 years for playing. I have built properties with my hands and
            it’s the same way I’ve destroyed many things with my hands. I have
            offended so many people including my friends and I take full
            responsibility for my actions,” he said.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As a way of announcing his new beginning, Funny Face said he has
            gone to wash himself at the sea, hoping to leave behind his past and
            start afresh.
