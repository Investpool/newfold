          The Deputy Minister of Education in charge of general education,
          Reverend John Ntim Fordjour, has said there has been an improvement in
          learning outcomes at the basic level due to interventions implemented
          in collaboration with partners in the country.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He said data from the National Standardised Test had revealed an
          increase in the number of learners who could read, from two per cent
          in 2015 to 38 per cent in 2022. Rev. Fordjour explained that the
          ministry had, for the past four years, collaborated with
          non-governmental organisation, Right To Play (RTP), to implement a
          Partners in Play Project (P3) to enhance the quality of education for
          children aged four to 12 years from 2019 to 2024.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The project was also aimed at incorporating play-based learning
          approaches into the school curriculum and teaching practices.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Rev.Fordjour was speaking at a dissemination session in Accra on the
          impact of learning through play. The event was organised by the
          Ministry of Education and RTP on the theme, "Accelerating learning
          outcomes through play-based approaches: Unlocking the successes and
          insight from play-based learning programmes in Ghana."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Rev.Fordjour said the government was transforming teaching and
          learning to address gaps in access and quality education in the
          country. “RTP approaches have impacted some 614 learners across the
          country and supported the Ghana Accountability for Learning Outcomes
          Projects (GALOP) schools targeted over 10,000 least performing
          schools,” he said.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He added that they had reached out to nearly 17,000 teachers who had
          been trained in play-based learning. “We have seen learners in the
          intervention schools reading 51 more words per minute than they were
          reading before the intervention and about 86 per cent of learners
          within those intervention schools,” he said.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He added that 81 per cent of teachers were also demonstrating
          effective play-based teaching and delivering confident learning to
          their learners through play-based pedagogy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Country Director of Right to Play, Josephine Mukakalisa, said the
          organisation had developed Gender Responsive Education and
          Transformation and trained more than 4,000 teachers from 2018 to 2023.
