            Over 14,000 Teachers sit for Ghana Teacher Licensure Examination

          23th April, 2024
        </div>
        <p>
          14,818 teachers made up of 6,659 fresh candidates and 8,159 others are
          testing for Teachers Licensure Examination across the countries.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The subject-based means that teacher trainees are going to be examined
          on their area of speciality, unlike previously when it was a
          generalised examination. During a visit to one of the examination
          centres at the Accra College of Education, a Deputy Minister of
          Education, Rev. John Ntim Fordjour, assured the candidates that the
          examination would enable them to teach in Ghana and anywhere in the
          world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The deputy minister said the education ministry was seeking financial
          clearance to post as many that would pass to various schools and
          communities where their services would be needed the most.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          "You have been trained in your various colleges of education and
          universities. The best of skills have been imbibed in you and this
          examination is one that is essential," Rev. Fordjour said.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He said the examination was to ensure they were the best professionals
          to deliver wherever they found themselves. Moreover, the Deputy
          Education Minister said it was also to ensure that they proudly and
          confidently walked into their classrooms wherever they were posted,
          knowing that they were professionals and had passed the requisite
          tests and had their licences to teach.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “I always say that the most crucial flight anyone can be on is
          education. But you will never be on a flight if the pilot doesn't have
          a licence to fly. Therefore, when you sit for this examination and
          pass to obtain your licence, it gives you the legitimate confidence to
          be among members of our noble profession," he said.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Having wished the candidates the best of luck in the examination, Rev.
          Fordjour later told the media that the examination was to ensure that
          after teachers were trained in the various colleges of education and
          universities, they possessed the minimum requirement to teach in
          classrooms in the country.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Those standards, he said, were the minimum requirement for any teacher
          to teach anywhere in the world. Rev. Fordjour said for the past six
          years that the GTLE had been implemented in the country, it had lifted
          the standard of teaching.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “It has impacted on outcomes that have led to improvements in the
          education sector,” he emphasised, saying he had not seen any
          profession in any part of the world that was as important as teaching.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The deputy minister, who was accompanied by the Board of Chairman of
          the National Teaching Council, Anis Haffar, said the GTLE was a policy
          that had come to stay. For his part, Mr Haffar said one of the most
          essential things of any profession, especially teaching, was for
          people to understand that teachers had to be licensed as
          professionals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He said there was no legitimate profession anywhere in the world
          without licensing. “The most important thing now is how teachers can
          stay abreast of development consistently,” he said.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          He cited Continuous Professional Development (CPD) as a tool for life
          long learning for teachers.
