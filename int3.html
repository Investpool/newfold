          US President Joe Biden said Tuesday that if Congress fails to pass Ukraine-Israel aid package it would give Russian President Vladimir Putin “the greatest Christmas gift.”
          “Congress needs to pass supplemental funding for Ukraine before they break for the holiday recess, before they give Putin the greatest Christmas gift they could possibly give him,” Biden said in the Oval Office alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  
<p>
          The president also announced an additional $200 million in drawdown funds for Ukraine. Zelensky is meeting with Biden after he met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to advocate for more aid as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues.

<p>
This is Zelensky’s third trip to Washington since the war began, he visited in September and met at that time with Biden in the Oval Office as well. Biden told Zelensky “it’s great to be at your side once again, we’re going to stay on your side.”
