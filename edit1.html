      <h3>
        THE BALANCE IN THE APPOINTMENT OF PERSONS WITH RESPONSIBILITIES IN
        PUBLIC OFFICES
      </h3>
      <p>
        Many schools of thought have propounded the importance of gender
        balance, regional balance, religious balance and tribal balance in the
        appointment of Ministers and other high offices of responsibility of
        the state.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Itâ€™s obvious that when two individuals, no matter their gender or
        other are placed on the same platform, one may certainly be of best
        quality than the other in knowledge and delivery. What if they all
        hail from same region?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To settle this issue of nation building, what we need at this stage of
        our development is the heads (brains) that carry pure knowledge and
        virtues.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        These fits are mostly ascertained by public opinion but not through
        connections by buddies here and there.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It is possible that an entire Region or Constituency may not have the
        needed manpower to spearhead a particular agenda. But because of our
        understanding of governorship, wrong people are made to occupy places
        that they have no knowledge about. This is evident in the state of our
        economy and growth as a nation. Heavy debts, low standards of living
        and poor infrastructures turn to be the effect of the choices of
        people we make to lead us in all our national endeavors.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There is hope that a day comes when responsible people are placed at
        responsible offices with adept responsibilities.
      </p>
