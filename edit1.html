      <h3>GROUNDNUT CULTIVATION, A TABOO IN AWUTU TRADITIONAL AREA</h3>
      <p>
        Awutu is a traditional enclave that falls within the transitional zone
        of the coast and the forest areas of the Central Region.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        They have arable lands that are once upon a time the home of yam
        production which is now overtaken by cassava.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        With the approach of urbanization, the size of agricultural lands get
        smaller, especially due to sand winning and estate development
        activities, rendering the farmers little or no lands to work on. These
        developments make them relocate to the cities, especially Kasoa for
        menial jobs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As a practice of many traditional areas in Ghana, poor quality soils are
        rejuvenated by planting legumes such as groundnut and others.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        On Awutu lands, this is not the case; it is a taboo to grow groundnut
        even in a small space of your backyard. Those who flout these
        traditional rules find themselves summoned to the traditional
        authorities, where they are warned and fined rams and rums.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Groundnut cultivation apart from fixing soil nutrients is a short means
        of cashing in revenue considering its market price now, and the fact
        that it is the major export commodity of the sahel regions of Mali,
        Niger and Bourkina Faso.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It is therefore advisable that the Ministry of Agriculture and the
        Ministry of Chieftancy and Religious Affairs collaborate with the Chiefs
        and people of Awutu Traditional Area to do away with practices and
        customs that are outmoded and spells economic doom for the country
        especially as the area turns to becoming more cosmopolitan with other
        races day by day.
