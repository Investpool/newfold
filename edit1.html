      <h3>BUILDING A STRONG ECONOMY OUT OF COURT FINES</h3>
      <p>
          Ghana’s quest for revenue mobilization is a daunting task for the
          government in the past and today.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It’s not like people don’t work, and because of that the state is
          broke. But people break laws that make it difficult for people to get
          what it takes to work efficiently.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The single thing that is at our disposal to make us functional is our
          laws.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Indeed, our laws are low hanging fruits the government should take
          advantage of to rake in millions of Ghana Cedis in court fines and to
          instill discipline into our system for other sectors to thrive.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>One may ask, why all these assertions?</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A case in point is the just ended Basic Education Certificate
          Examination, where law breakers were seen in all corners across the
          country doing things contrary to the set rules of the state.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Fraudsters with known phone numbers using fake accounts of “big men”
          on Facebook perpetrating dastardly act on unsuspecting victims are
          things that the state intelligence actors should be interested in, so
          as to make some fortune for the state.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          People littering their environment with disdain, just to mention a
          few.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A research shows that Kenya for instance made about $9.3 million from
          court fines alone in recent times.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is believed in all circles that Ghana has the potential to make
          more revenue in court fines with the surge in law breakings than gold
          and cocoa.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our intelligence networks must be on top of the game to achieve this
          reality.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our Court Penalties Act 2000 (Act 572) must be boldly employed to
          augment the financial strives of the state.
        </p>
