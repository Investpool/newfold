      <h3>FULL EMPLOYMENT IN GHANA'S PERSPECTIVE</h3>
      <p>
        'There is no work in Ghana'. We say there's work in Ghana depending on
        the lens through which we see the naratives from various angles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The early economists as Keynes postulates full employment as a
        yard-stick for a good quality of life. It further asserts that any able
        bodied person who wants to work can find employment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Work, in simple terms is the combination of all factors of production
        that brings about an output, which are goods and services consumed by
        the masses. In our part of the world, so much emphasis is paid to labour
        within the chain of these factors that all the others are barely
        considered or partially tapped.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The following points show details of all factors worth considering:<br />
        <b>Labour</b> - the human resources (workmen, engineers, lawyers,
        teachers, medics, administrators) etc.<br />
        <b>Land</b> - rivers, lakes, seas, forests, agricultural lands, mineral
        deposits, air space.<br />
        <b>Capital</b> - man-made resources acquired by use of money.<br />
        <b>Entrepreneurship</b> - organisational resources for management and
        coordination (governments and individuals).<br />
        <b>Information and Technology</b> - use of data and technology in all
        aspects of production processes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our problem for not attaining full employment is the fact that less
        projection is made for the quality of life for the average Ghanaian.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        If Koohia, a farmer in the Atiwa District is deemed fit to at least,
        live in a decent self owned house, it should take the government as the
        chief entrepreneur to easily coordinate all the rest of the factors of
        production to his advantage. That's making him produce better. In doing
        these, the subsequent action is that other factors are going to be
        activated as they are needed to complete the cycle.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It is therefore expected that routine analysis is made about the
        quantum, in percentage terms, how much of the factors of production is
        tapped and how much is left untapped so that potential entrepreneurs can
        set into motion what needs to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
        The function of the government in this case is to coordinate for the
        betterment of all citizens in a frank manner. Nothing else.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A positive outlook at the above discussion renders all people happy and
        productive for a Great Nation.
      </p>
