      <h3> RIVER GUARD RECRUITMENTS IS NO WHERE NEAR THE END TO GALAMSEY</h3>
        <p>
          Be it a state, organizations or individuals, four fundamental
          principles that plunder us into absolute development are action,
          inaction, commission and omission of decisions. Beyond these, there is
          nothing than knowledge as the bedrock on which the four thrives.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Knowledge abounds in Ghana, looking at what our universities and other
          educational institutions churn out on yearly bases. Nonetheless, our
          professors and other professionals are remarkable. What matters is the
          index in which the four parameters described above are applied under
          particular circumstance.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We make a case for the recruitment of River Guards in the pursuit of
          ending galamsey in the country. This is indeed an action. But the
          question is can it help or not. If not, inaction, premised on this
          decision is the most appropriate index to adopt. Certainly, it is a
          very bad action taken by the government. First, joint military and
          police did same and were largely not successful. What can we say about
          a mere unarmed River Guard?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For popular opinion, these young men and women must rather be
          considered for an enterprise around agriculture, where short term
          training is given to them to operate machineries and equipment. As it
          becomes sustainable and food production volumes increase, all things
          would fall in place. That’s where thousands of people engaged in
          Galamsey would relinquish their “old job” and join the masses in the
          new agricultural reality.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>In this case, inaction would have won the bid for that decision.</p>
