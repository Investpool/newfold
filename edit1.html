      <h3>
        THE RELEVANCE OF GHANAIAN TEACHERS IN NATION BUILDING, A CASE IN FEW
        IRREGULARITIES IN 2024 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION COLLATIONS
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        It has been a tested case that any duty a person who has ever been to
        a college of education and called a teacher performs is done
        creditably for at least devoid of wanton corruption.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Going back, Professor John Evans Atta Mills and Kwame Nkrumah stood
        tall as the best among their peers in serving this country truthfully,
        to the satisfaction of every level-headed Ghanaian because they were
        teachers who had gone through Training Colleges.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A call to these analyses is premised on the happenings around the
        country where polling stations that did not field teachers as
        Presiding Officers, Returning officers and Collation Officers in the
        various constituencies had to face myriads of irregularities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If indeed the officers who manned these desks were teachers, it could
        be the types who did not attend Colleges of Education, but products of
        universities that ended up in the classrooms. Such teachers, because
        of their flare for money, they become easily corrupted. That is the
        problem we are seeing today.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Colleges of Education are good training grounds for the best materials
        that teach our future generations, because I can say, it is an
        embodiment of virtues. If for any reason itâ€™s thought through to make
        it look like normal universities, Ghana has a big price to pay in the
        future.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Electoral commission must in its future engagements, use genuine
        teachers without party colors to conduct elections.
      </p>
