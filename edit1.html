      <h3>
        A FIGHT FOR GHANA’ S NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE GALAMSEY MENACE
      </h3>
      <p>
        At the brinks of time, Galamsey or small scale mining is ending pretty
        soon. Thanks to the organized labour and the good citizens of Ghana in
        the pursuit of this daunting task. Governments have failed, and all
        regulatory authorities have failed.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        As hope is on sight, it is imperative to ponder over alternative
        livelihood measures for the small scale miners, in that, families are
        not exposed to dangers of hardships.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        There is a Yoruba proverb that says – “Responsibility does not devolve
        on the father only for him to say it is his son’s duty”.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Government has all it takes to know, through digitalization processes,
        that certain categories of citizens are in parts of the country that may
        become potential small scale miners. That is to say less effort was
        made by the state to seek the welfare of millions of citizens in the
        wild.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Now that farmlands had been destroyed, farms ravaged and water bodies
        extremely polluted, what’s going to be the consequences of all these?
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Social intervention formulae needs to be employed as a matter of
        urgency to switch the labour required for these miners so that the
        effect of redundancy is not activated to breed more problems.
        Constitutionally, they have rights to work and to live.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        The social intervention can take the forms of international and
        government grants for speedy resettlement purposes.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        We must remember every able bodied citizen of a sound mind is an asset
        to the state.
      </p><br>
