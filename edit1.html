      <h3>APPOINTMENT OF DISTRICT CHIEF EXECUTIVES AND THE THINGS THAT MATTER</h3>
      <p>
        It must be an optimum expectation of all District Chief Executives to
        put revenue mobilization as their top priorities. In other
        jurisdictions, much revenue is generated within the district to pay
        remunerations for government workers, their staff and contract fees.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What becomes of Ghana’s local government system? About 90 percent of
        revenues are rolled away. Probably, scrutinized measures of capturing
        these essential monies are lacking.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Rent taxes as per Rent Act, 1963 (Act 220),  which now stands at 8 percent must be looked at with a
        serious eye. Here, the Land Lords and Tenants must collaborate for the
        District to derive the full benefit from this.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        That’s to say for a property to be rented out, a prescribed Tenancy
        Agreement Form must be sourced from the District Assembly. A duplicate
        of the form with appropriate tax payment must be returned to the District
        Office for validation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Tenants can be awarded a subsidy on percentage terms of the tax paid by
        their landlords by way of cushioning their expenses.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Assembly Members must be at the fore front of these transactions
        as their core mandate.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Any infraction on the law on the part of members of the Assemblies,
        Land Lords, ant Tenants must be dealt with appropriately for a
        multiplier outcomes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        These and others such as property tax, market tolls and annual
        payment of all artisans such as tailors, seamstresses, mechanics etc.
        can go a long way to keep the finances of the districts healthy.
      </p>
