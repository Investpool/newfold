      <h3>PRICES OF COMMODITIES AND THEIR IMPACT ON CONSUMERS AND INDUSTRY</h3>

      <p>
        "Prices are too much!" That's the usual cry of the average Ghanaian.
        Indeed, this has impacted negatively on the efforts of governments in
        the past and present.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        An optimal growth of industry is dear to the heart of every government
        and its people as equally as low prices of industrial goods and services
        to the final consumer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>The metrics that heals the above phenomenom cannot be far fetched.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As industry produces goods and services, there must be a check on the
        intermediary players (middlemen) in such a manner that price increases
        would not affect the final consumer. Research has revealed that some
        commodities have as much as four middlemen between the producer and the
        final consumer. What it means is each member within the chain makes a
        margin on the same good or service. By the time it reaches the final
        consumer the prices escalate beyond imagination. Unfortunately, it is
        the poor of the poor country men and women who are the most affected.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It takes the commitment of governments through legislations and the
        like, to control these developments as it may drastically reduce prices
        of goods and services. To cite few examples - in the past, Ghana Highway
        Authority or PWD directly employs and pay workmen to clear along major
        roads across the country. Government directly procures goods to a state
        run GNTC in the least developed communities as retail outlets to common
        people. Life was good. Because it was like from the manufactures
        straight to consumers. No middleman.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The above thinking may bring about increased consumption, favourable
        competition with imported goods, low demand for foreign currency,
        middlemen being employed by industries because of expanded base due to
        increased demand, increased government revenue on account of increased
        formal employment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When serious attention is paid to these things, we may once attain the
        height we desired as a nation.<br />
