            The Group CEO of Media General Limited, Madam Beatrice Agyemang who
            was adjudged the 2023 ‘WOMAN OF THE YEAR’ at the prestigious EMY
            Africa Awards event, has urged business leaders to innovate and keep
            pace with the needs of customers. Speaking to journalists at the
            launch of the 8th edition of the EMY Africa magazine in Accra on
            Saturday, April 6, she said businesses will only remain relevant if
            they evolve at a fast pace to meet the growing needs of customers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            “It is a fantastic piece put together by the EMY Africa Africa team.
            I love to see businesses grow, what I want to tell all industries is
            to learn to anticipate the ever-growing needs of customers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            “The needs of customers keep evolving at a very fast pace and you
            will only remain relevant if you evolve at a fast pace, you need to
            adapt, you need to innovate, and you need to live with purpose. I
            encourage leaders to live with purpose and also ensure that they
            meet the needs of their customers,” she said.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>

          </p>
          <br />
          <p>

            building your organisation into one of the most successful media
            organisations in Ghana today,” Executive Director of EMY Africa,
