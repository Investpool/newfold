        <h2>THE SMART WAY TO PAY ELECTRICITY TARRIF 100 PERCENT</h2>
        <p>
          Energy sector levy of Ghc1 is slapped on every litre of fuel across
          all sales points.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of the imposition of the tax is to solve the looming
          energy crises owing to the debt of $3.1b that has been accummulated
          over the years and approximately $3.7 billion is required to clear all
          arrears.
        </p>
        <p>The projected proceeds from the levy is said to be about Ghc5.7b.</p>
        <p>
          Thats is a very smart way adopted by the NDC government. In the face
          of these, fuel prices has seen marginal reductions. Thanks to the cedi
          appreciation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A voice from the rooftop suggests that as the government is not able
          to collect electricity tarrifs (currently at 30%) from consumers for
          which the debt escalates to this level,
          <i style="color: yellow"
            >further imposition of the tax should be done so that domestic,
            commercial and institutional consumers use electricity for free.</i
