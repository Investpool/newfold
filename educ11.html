            Minority Caucus MPs call for immediate interdiction of Scholarship
            Secretariat registrar

          9th April, 2024

        <p>
          The Minority Caucus of Ghana’s parliament has called for the immediate
          interdiction of the Registrar of the Ghana Scholarship Secretariat,
          Kingsley Agyemang, over an investigative report which showed several
          irregularities in the award of scholarships.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In a statement issued on April 8, 2024, the National Democratic
          Congress (NDC) Members of (MPs) indicated that even though the
          Scholarship Secretariat was set up to support needy and brilliant
          Ghanaians to further their education, the report showed that
          scholarships were awarded by the secretariat through corruption and
          political considerations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The MPs added that Kingsley Agyemang must be interdicted and
          investigated because the claims of corruption and favouritism in the
          award of scholarships were corroborated by several Ghanaians.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “The investigations, which span the period between 2019 and 2020,
          reveal very sordid details of the award of Government of Ghana
          scholarships on the basis of political patronage, influence,
          favouritism, among other considerations, contrary to the object of
          these scholarships which are supposed to be given to deserving, needy
          but brilliant students.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “The series of investigations by the Fourth Estate have since been
          corroborated by other patriotic Ghanaians, both home and abroad. Many
          have cited instances of extortion, bribery and collection of kickbacks
          allegedly involving the Registrar of the Ghana Scholarship
          Secretariat, Kingsley Agyemang, and other officials,” part of the
          statement reads.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The MPs also said that the revelations from the investigation also
          affirms the level of corruption in the government, with persons close
          to the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the presidency all getting hefty
          scholarships.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “The investigation further revealed that in one instance, an official
          of the NPP was awarded multiple scholarships to the tune of £57,210
          for a post-graduate course, while a Special Assistant to the spouse of
          the Vice President, Samira Bawumia, was awarded £17,355 for
          post-graduate studies in the UK. Interestingly, Samira Bawumia’s
          Special Assistant did not step foot at the school, nor complete the
          programme.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “Widespread reports of multiple scholarships worth several thousands
          of dollars, sometimes awarded to the same individuals in same year,
          reveal the extent of abuse of the taxpayers money. Worst of all, it
          has been reported that these awards are sometimes handed to
          NPP-aligned persons for two-week training programmes abroad, in return
          for some kickback,” the statement added.
