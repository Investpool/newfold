          The Pensioner Bondholders Forum has threatened to resume its picketing
          at the premises of the Ministry of Finance if the government fails to
          pay all outstanding coupons and principals of bond investments by
          April 28, 2023. The forum in a statement signed by its Convener, Dr.
          Adu Anane Antwi expressed disappointment over the government’s
          inconsistency regarding assurances to pay all pensioners their
          outstanding coupons and principals of bond investments. The Convener
          of the Forum expressed the pain and financial hardships members have
          had to go through as a result of the delay and requested that the
          payments be made as demanded in the Forum’s letter of March 30, 2023,
          to the Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta. “We wish to state that we
          have granted the Ministry a one-week extension to the 21st of April
          2023 deadline in our letter of 30th March 2023 for the payment of all
          outstanding coupons and principles, bringing the deadline now to 28th
          April 2023.”
