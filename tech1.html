          The Veterinary Medical and Technicians Association of Ghana has called
          on the government to expedite the financial clearance and posting of
          unemployed veterinary officers who have completed their training and
          are awaiting employment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This plea comes after the Coalition of Unemployed Veterinary Officers
          of Ghana issued a 21-day ultimatum, demanding an explanation from the
          government regarding the delay in clearing the remaining 550
          veterinary officers, along with those who have finished their
          mandatory National Service.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Association emphasized the critical need for more Veterinary
          Medical and Technicians to ensure public health safety.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="ad1">

          The coalition claims its members are struggling to survive due to the
          lack of job opportunities and is demanding the release of financial
          clearance and postings for all 550 unemployed technical officers and
          nurses who have completed their national service from 2018 to the
          present.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In response to the students’ demands, the Head of Public Relations for
          the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Bagbara Tanko, stated that the
          ministry is collaborating with the Finance Ministry to obtain the
          necessary clearance for the recruitment process.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “As we may all recall in 2021 when we had an outbreak of the bird flu,
          it exposed the human resources challenge of the veterinary services,
          so the government then brought in some interventions to meet the
          situation.”
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          “Among them was a clearance to recruit about 1,100 veterinary experts
          which included doctors and technicians. Since then, about 720 have
          been done. The remaining number to be recruited stands at 380, for
          which we are still waiting for the Ministry of Finance to give us
          clearance.”
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Emmanuel Esseian, President of the Veterinary Medical and Technicians
          Association of Ghana, appealed to the government to empathise with the
          students.
        </p>

        <p>
          He highlighted the challenges the service faces amidst the shortage of
          staff, noting that the absence of these personnel has led many farmers
          to resort to unprofessional treatment of their animals, thereby
          jeopardizing public health.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Mr Esseian also emphasized the importance of employing these officers
          to boost the poultry industry and support government policies on
          agriculture.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          “The planting for food and jobs 2.0, there’s a portion that we deal
          with poultry and one of our main problems with poultry in this country
          apart from the cost of production is also animal outbreaks, animal
          diseases. So all these individuals when employed will help boost the
          poultry industry and government policy on agriculture will succeed.”
